# surfs_up
Analyzing temperature trends before opening the surf shop using Jupyter Notebook, SQLite and Flask
# Overview of the analysis
This analysis provides the trends in temperature in two specific months June and Decebember through the years to give a good understanding of temperature fluctuations between possibly the hottest and coldest month of any year, if any, in Oahu. This data will be helpful in gaining understanding the impacts temperature fluctuations may have on the surf shop business. 

# Results
## June
### In the month of June:
* The mean temperature is 74.9F 
* The min temperature is 64F
* The max temperature is 85F

### In the month of December:
* The mean temperature is 71F

# Summary
There is a very little difference in the mean and max temperatures between the months of June and December, however the min temperature has a significant difference. Practically, it may mean, that the business of surfing and icecream probably will not be affected much through the entire year assuming the rest of the months have similar data. That means, we can use the same code to run the same analysis for the rest of the months. Also, it would be great to analyze the precipitation through the different months along with analyzing which stations are used (or if there are any differences in the data between various stations).
